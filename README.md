# **Thoht - Advanced Image Processing Application**

**Thoht** is a powerful GUI-based application for advanced image processing tasks. Leveraging modern GUI frameworks and image processing libraries, Thoht allows users to apply various effects like pseudocolor, noise reduction, PCA, and more, all within a sleek and user-friendly interface.

## **Features**
- **CustomTkinter Interface:** A modern, dark-themed interface using `customtkinter`.
- **Pseudocolor Effects:** Apply pseudocolor to images using various techniques.
- **Noise Reduction:** Enhance image quality by reducing noise.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Perform PCA on images for dimensionality reduction.
- **Real-Time Processing:** View changes to your images in real-time as you apply effects.
- **Easy File Management:** Simple file dialog for loading and saving images.
