  title: "Thoht - Advanced Image Processing Application"
  description: >
    Thoht is a powerful GUI-based application for advanced image processing tasks. Leveraging modern GUI frameworks and image processing libraries, Thoht allows users to apply various effects like pseudocolor, noise reduction, PCA, and more, all within a sleek and user-friendly interface.

features:
  - "CustomTkinter Interface: A modern, dark-themed interface using `customtkinter`."
  - "Pseudocolor Effects: Apply pseudocolor to images using various techniques."
  - "Noise Reduction: Enhance image quality by reducing noise."
  - "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Perform PCA on images for dimensionality reduction."
  - "Real-Time Processing: View changes to your images in real-time as you apply effects."
  - "Easy File Management: Simple file dialog for loading and saving images."

installation:
  steps:
    - "Clone the repository:"
      command: |
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thoht.git
        cd thoht
        ```
    - "Install the required dependencies:"
      command: |
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - "Run the application:"
      command: |
        ```bash
        python thoht.py
        ```

usage:
  steps:
    - "Launch the application by running the `thoht.py` file."
    - "Load Images using the file dialog to load the images you want to process."
    - "Apply Effects by toggling various flags like pseudocolor, noise reduction, PCA, etc., to see real-time changes."
    - "Save Results by saving the processed images through the GUI."

example_workflow:
  steps:
    - "Open the application and load an image."
    - "Apply the desired effects (e.g., pseudocolor)."
    - "Preview the changes in the application."
    - "Save the final image to your desired location."
